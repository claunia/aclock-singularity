# aclock-singularity
Aclock is an analog clock program for text mode console displays, terminals, or terminal emulators. This program is obviously absolutely useless, except for turning your old, expensive mainframe or supercomputer into a wall clock.

This version is for Singularity OS.
Copy the aclock folder to Singularity base/Applications path and build world.
